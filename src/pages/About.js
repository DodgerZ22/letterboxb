            <h4>What is cinema?</h4>
            <p>Movies have evolved for as long as they existed. Various genres have reinvented
                the cinematic experience. Yet as genres such as superheroes, comedies, and action
                continue to dominate pop culture; the ideal essence of cinema continues to be forgotten.
                Letterboxb is meant to expose a new generation of film lovers to the pictures that 
                inspired the movies we love today. Cinema is not dead, let us remind each other what it is.
